	<h1 id="about">About</h1>
		<p>I am a Berlin-based Expert for Online Marketing and UX Design and have been working for more than six years in marketing and content creation in the Berlin 	startup-scene. Recently, I decided to give my career a new twist by signing-up at Career Foundry to deepen my knowledge and become a UX Design Expert. 
		As a designer, I want to add value to the world by designing useful products. I want to contribute to solving problems for real people, to make their lives easier, more organized, educated or eco-friendly. My longterm experience in Online Marketing and Content Creation are useful assets on that mission. 
		Right now I am looking for interesting teams and positions where I can apply my previous and newly aquired knowledge. If you think I could be a great addition to your team, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:nadja.braeunig@gmail.com">contact me</a> or check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadja-braeunig">LinkedIn profile!</a></p>
